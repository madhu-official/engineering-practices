## Executive Summary
LLMOps is primarily focused on lifecycle management, development, deployment and governance of LLM's in PRODUCTION environments. This document provides a comprehensive framework for implementing LLMOps practices, addressing the distinct requirements of LLM workflows including prompt engineering, fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment at scale.

## Introduction to LLMOps
Similar to any IT operations, its a set of tools, guidelines, practices that drive the development, deployment, monitoring and continuous improvement of applications powered by LLM's.

### Key Challenges

- How to scale?
- How to manage hallucinations?
- How to measure and optimize the cost model?
- How to optimize the prompts?
- How to evaulate the model in terms of performance and accuracy?
- What kind of guardrails should be put in place?
- How to make it more predictable with a right set of feedback loop?


## Guiding Principles

- **Security and Privacy:** Prevent unauthorized access and sensitive information leak
- **Compliance:** Adhere to the legal, regulatory and internal organization policies and procedures
- **Reliabile and Robust:** Perform tasks in a more consistent fashion and predicatable. Robust error handling and resilient to unexpected or malicious inputs 
- **Efficient and Scalable:** Cost effective and able to scale on demand
- **Responsible and Ethical:** Unbiased and fair responses aligned with Organization procedures
- **Observable and Auditable:** E2E traceability and audit information available at every step
- **With Human Oversight:** Human intervention or escalation for sensitive tasks
- **Continuous feedback:** Continuous learning, improvement based on the feedback loop
